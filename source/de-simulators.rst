=============================
Simulation using SITL
=============================

You do not need to have a real drone to test Drone-Engage cabapilities. Actually it is recommended to use `SITL <https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html>`_ simulation to test Drone-Engage before actually flying long range with your drone. 

If you want more real action then maybe you can try `Webots SITL <https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-with-webots.html>`_ to have a real taste of how using Drone-Engage really feels.
